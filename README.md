# SLDS-Street-Veredict
SLDS Project (UPC) - Street Veredict

This is a university project, done by Pau Torrents i Gallego and Eduard Maestro Mart√≠nez. The objective of the project was to create a Free Software product to share with the world.

In our case, we chose Street Veredict, a Web/API where you can find, given a keyword or a topic, relevant information provided by different sources (newspaper...), including articles written by our users.

This way, with a look it is possible to compare the *objetivity* of each source and take a better global idea about the topic.
